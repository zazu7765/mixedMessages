# Mixed Messages #

## Context ##

this is a small project I had to do which involved 'mixed messages'.  
All done in vanilla javascript, of course with arrow syntax because I want to keep that skill up.
All in all, we have a bunch of arrow functions, a for loop, and a switch case.

## Instructions ##

Download using whatever method you want either as a zip or git repo.  
Navigate to the file location and do `node index.js`.  
You should immediately see the results pop up in your console!
